# RedJillCardGame
My take on Black Jack. This game will have a human player and a computer (dealer). From the mainActivity the user will have the choice to play as a single player, (EXTRA) Multiplayer, (EXTRA) see stats and read the rules. This first sketch is what I aim to be able to create in Android studios.
The layout may differ since Figma is sooo much easier than to actually code this in Android studios :) I might make my own cards or import pictures from google.    

EXTRA Multiplayer. If there's time, a multiplayer option will be added. Two players will the be able to play against the dealer (computer). They will take turns to play. A TextView will tell which player's turn it is.  

EXTRA Stats. Stats from singel player (EXTRA multiplayer) will be stored in StatsActivity that will be accessed from MainActivity. 

Play again button will take the user back to MainActivity.
